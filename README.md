# Kyiv-Metro-Screen-review

This is my project of emulation of the information screen from the Kyiv metro. My project is private and is not distributed on the Internet. It implements the functions of displaying arrival and departure from the station, a list of the next 6 stations with the time until arrival to them, as well as transfer to other lines. There is also a display of the objects closest to the station, such as a high-speed tram, a city train, train stations, trains and buses to the airport and a funicular.

Below you can watch a video of the emulator in action
